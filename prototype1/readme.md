Note: A6 does not work as an input because no pullup. Actually, A6 and A7 are weird
And should be avoided.

## history

This prototype was meant to replace prototype0 in summer 2021, but there was no
time to develop the software. The software will be developed in California, tested
and validated.

Once prototype 1 is complete, a RevA PCB will be designed and the entire solution
will be shipped to Switzerland for installation (connectors have been set in place)
and ultimate validation.
